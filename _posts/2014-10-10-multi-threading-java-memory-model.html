title: Multi-Threading & Java Memory Model
---

Hello. Been sometime since I posted anything but I broke my silence to talk about Java Memory Model.Okay so here is the game-plan, first we&#8217;ll talk about some problems Java has that you won&#8217;t notice unless you are doing something multi-threaded, analyze them and then we&#8217;ll look how we can avoid such problems and where the memory model swoops-in to rescue. Does my program get executed in the order it [&#8230;]
