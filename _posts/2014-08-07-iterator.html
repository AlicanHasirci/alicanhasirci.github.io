One of the most commonly used data structure used in programming is genericly called a collection. A collection is a group of objects in same type or sometimes casted to a base type like anObject instance. Arrays, lists, vectors, maps whatever you can think about falls into this category. This being said, a structure to iterate over these elements of group haves utmost importance. This is where the iterator comes [&#8230;]
