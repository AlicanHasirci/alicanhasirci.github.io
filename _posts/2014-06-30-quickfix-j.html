As my first post i thought i&#8217;d write on what i am working on nowadays. Few months ago i accepted a work to write a QuickFix integration solution since Borsa Istanbul was having a transition to quickfix. Even though i never had worked with QuickFix i thought i&#8217;d give it a try. I am writing this hoping that my experiances will help someone since there are not much resources on [&#8230;]
